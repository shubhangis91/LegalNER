To build corpus
------------------
1. Keep TSV data files in the same folder as the MLCL - Project - Corpus.ipynb
2. The notebook would create a file train.txt in the path
	data_folder = './project/example/ner/test/'
	
	This would be the corpus to be used in the MLCL_Project.ipynb file.

To train model
------------------
1. Keep train.txt in the same folder as the file MLCL_Project.ipynb
2. The resultant model files (training.png, best-model.pt) will be in the path
	./project/example/ner
